The MultiThreadChat program consists of two parts, the Server class and Client class - each performing their relevant functions for a
multithreaded multi-user chat program. 

Intended use is to run the Server class first, and then run any number of Client instances which will connect to the Server instance. This
program only supports clients run locally, not over a network.
